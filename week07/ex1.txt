Throughput:

The "Worst Fit" algorithm has the highest throughput at 72.96 queries/second, indicating that it can handle a larger number of queries in a given time frame.
The "First Fit" algorithm follows closely with a throughput of 72.12 queries/second.
The "Best Fit" algorithm has the lowest throughput at 70.96 queries/second, meaning it processes queries less efficiently than the other two algorithms.

To summarize, the "Worst Fit" algorithm performs well in terms of total allocation time and throughput,
 making it a good choice for scenarios where speed and efficiency are critical. 
 The "First Fit" algorithm is also competitive in terms of throughput and time. 
 The "Best Fit" algorithm, while not significantly slower, has slightly lower performance compared 
 to the other two algorithms in this specific context.
