Based on the simulation outputs, here's a summary of the hit ratios for the three different page replacement algorithms:

Random Replacement Algorithm: Hit Ratio = 0.857143
NFU (Not Frequently Used) Algorithm: Hit Ratio = 0.714286
Aging Algorithm: Hit Ratio = 0.714286


From these results, we can see that the random replacement algorithm performed slightly better than NFU and Aging in this particular 
scenario. The NFU and Aging algorithms both yielded the same hit ratio. 
These results might seem unintuitive at first because one might expect algorithms that consider page reference history 
(like NFU and Aging) to outperform a naive approach like random replacement.
