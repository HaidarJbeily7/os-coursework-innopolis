**Experiment 1: Creating and Monitoring Hard Links**

1. Created a file 'myfile1.txt' with WD 1.
2. Opened 'myfile1.txt'.
3. Modified 'myfile1.txt'.
4. Created 'myfile11.txt' with WD 1.
5. Created 'myfile12.txt' with WD 1.
6. Opened 'myfile11.txt'.
7. Modified 'myfile11.txt'.
8. Created 'myfile13.txt' with WD 1.

**Observations:**

- When 'myfile1.txt' was created, the monitor.c program reported a creation event with WD 1.
- When 'myfile1.txt' was opened, the monitor.c program reported an open event.
- When 'myfile1.txt' was modified, the monitor.c program reported a modification event.
- When 'myfile11.txt' and 'myfile12.txt' were created as hard links to 'myfile1.txt', the monitor.c program reported creation events for both with WD 1.
- When 'myfile11.txt' was opened, the monitor.c program reported an open event.
- When 'myfile11.txt' was modified, the monitor.c program reported a modification event.
- When 'myfile13.txt' (symbolic link) was created in the watched directory, the monitor.c program reported a creation event with WD 1.

**Questions:**

- Modify the file myfile11.txt (its content). Did the monitor.c program report an event for myfile11.txt?
  - Answer: Yes, the monitor.c program reported a modification event when 'myfile11.txt' was modified. This indicates that changes to 'myfile11.txt' are monitored and reported.

- Create a symbolic link myfile13.txt in the watched directory to /tmp/myfile1.txt. Modify the file /tmp/myfile1.txt (its content). Did the monitor.c program report an event for myfile13.txt?
  - Answer: No, the monitor.c program did not report an event for 'myfile13.txt' when '/tmp/myfile1.txt' was modified. This is because symbolic links typically do not generate events when their target files are modified; instead, events occur on the target file itself ('/tmp/myfile1.txt' in this case).
